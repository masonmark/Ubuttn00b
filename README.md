# ðŸ’© Ubuttn00b

A script for performing some initial setup on a brand new Ubuttnu linux installation. (Imperatively, *LIKE AN ANIMAL* â€” )

This is not likely to be useful to you; it is public only so that I may invoke it without any kind of authentication fuckery:

`deno run -A https://raw.githubusercontent.com/masonmark/Ubuttn00b/main/main.deno.ts`
